Thanks for stopping by! My name is Andrew, and I've been a developer for over 8 years! In that time I've worked mostly with front-end codebases ranging from vanilla to Angular, React, and Vue! I've built a lot of things for clients over the years, and I love getting challenging work. 

Outside of code I am also an avid gamer, and I love lifting weights.

Learning what it takes to be a higher level engineer. Anybody can code, and get good at coding, but what does it take to be a leader? What does being a good leader even mean? I've been asking myself this for a while now. I'm taking steps to level up my career.
