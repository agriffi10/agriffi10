## 📖 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 m𝚎

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Andrew, and I've been a developer for over 8 years! In that time I've worked mostly with front-end codebases ranging from vanilla to Angular, React, and Vue! I've built a lot of things for clients over the years, and I love getting challenging work. 

Outside of code I am also an avid gamer, and I love lifting weights.

### Getting Started

### Contributing

Learning what it takes to be a higher level engineer. Anybody can code, and get good at coding, but what does it take to be a leader? What does being a good leader even mean? I've been asking myself this for a while now. I'm taking steps to level up my career.

### Side Projects

- [React Chess Game](https://rococo-bavarois-680f44.netlify.app/) - This was something I did as a quick technical assessment, but I really enjoyed making it so I kept it around. You can checkout the code [here](https://github.com/agriffi10/react-chess?tab=readme-ov-file).

### Professional Work

Here are a few cool things I've worked on in the past. A lot of work actually takes place behind the scenes because I work a lot on internal apps. These are a few things I have worked on that are publically available.
